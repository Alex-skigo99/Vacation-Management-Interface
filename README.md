## Explanation

This project is implemented on a single server, with TypeScript as the primary language. The backend is developed using the Express library and follows the REST API approach. The code is organized into modules: routers, controllers, and models. The Zod library is used for validating incoming data. Error handling is performed in middleware.

UI is built with functional components using hooks. Usied one CSS file approach. For a more user-friendly interface, dialog modals from the Material UI library were utilized. Screen selection occurs automatically based on the selected userâ€™s role. This simplified approach can later be replaced with a fully-featured user authorization system.
